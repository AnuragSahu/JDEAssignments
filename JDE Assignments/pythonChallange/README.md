# Python Challange :

Conway's Game of Life is all about simulating real life rules on some random arrangement of cells in a given environment. The rules are as follows.

    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
- Implement GameOfLife as a python module
- have the configurations saved in a config.json file

- Instructions to run the code 
```
python main.py
```
